# Book-OOP-TranDanThu
This is the practice of me with lessons in the book "Object-Oriented Programming" of Tran Dan Thu, Dinh Ba Tien and Nguyen Tan Tran Minh Khang.  
The book was written in Vietnamse.
**Vietnamese name:** Lập trình hướng đối tượng.  
It displayed the basic techniques of OOP, with C++.  
Some chapters had the comparisons to two OOP languages: C# and Java.
